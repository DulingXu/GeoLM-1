Maybe you need to do some pre-preparation before you can use the test script

# The go environment is necessary

# The tc tool is also necessary to set up in the container

You can check and install tc by running the script tool_check.py, which contains an operation to check and install three containers. You can also install it manually.
The installation requirements and precautions can also be found in the script.


```bash
python3 tool_check.py
```
